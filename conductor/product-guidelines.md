# Product Guidelines

## Brand & Identity
- **Name Meaning:** "rher" is a portmanteau of **Reader** and **Hearer**, reflecting a vision for both visual and auditory content consumption.
- **Current Focus:** The initial implementation focuses exclusively on the **Reader** functionality, providing a premium experience for text-based content.

## Visual Identity
- **Minimalist & Clean:** The design will prioritize white space and a restrained color palette to ensure the user's focus remains entirely on the text. Subtle shadows and smooth transitions will be used to provide depth without adding visual noise.

## Tone and Voice
- **Calm & Unobtrusive:** All interface copy and system messages will be brief and helpful. The application should feel like a quiet companion, staying in the background and only providing information when strictly necessary or helpful to the reading flow.

## Design Principles
- **Content First:** Every design decision must serve the readability and accessibility of the reading content.
- **Low Cognitive Load:** Interactions should be intuitive and require minimal effort, allowing for a seamless transition from "using an app" to "reading a book."
